ABSTRACT:
Fire safety is one of the major concerns for a safe home environment.
Current implementations of home or workplace environment monitoring systems consist of rudimentary smoke detectors devoid of any communication capabilities.
Recent trends in the industry have shown a growth in the use of smart devices at homes and with the recent advances in areas of machine learning and data sciences,
this trend is expected to evolve at a rate faster than ever before. 
These smart devices constantly monitor the data of their environment and make decisions by performing data analytics on those observations.
Amazon Echo is one such example where an 'always-listening' device responds intelligently to a speaker's command giving its users a Smart Home experience.
In this implementation, we harness the developments in aforementioned areas to make Smart Fire Alarm System
The project invloves  Arduino uno,LM-35 Temperature sensor,gas sensor,resistors,Bread board,LED,piezo Buzzer,jump wires.
In this temperature sensor takes in input and rise in temperature and voltage buzzer rings, for Gas sensor is also used to detect smoke along with the concentration of gases
