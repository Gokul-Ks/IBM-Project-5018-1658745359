ASSIGNMENT - 1 [ Smart Home using 2+ sensors, Led, Buzzer in single code and circuit. ]

Abstract:

Security has always been a major concern for all of us and there are many Hi tech and 
IoT based security and surveillance system are available in the market.
Intruder or Burglar Alarm is one of the classic and popular project among the Electronics students and hobbyists.
We have also built many Burglar Alarms based on various technologies:
	Laser Security Alarm Circuit	IR Based Security Alarm


	Burglar Alarm using PIR
	        GSM Based Security System
Today we are adding one more Security Alarm in our list which is based on Ultrasonic Sensor.
 This Arduino Controlled Door alarm can be installed near the door to detect the presence of anybody at the door.
 Whenever somebody comes in the range of Ultrasonic sensor, buzzer starts beeping.
 You can adjust the sensor detection range according to your door.
 This system can also serve the purpose of Motion Detector also it measures the temperature of a person and 
 inform us through the temperature sensor.

The LED is glown to indicate that the circuit is active.
Required Components:

•	Ultrasonic Sensor
•	Buzzer
•	Arduino Uno
•	Temperatue sensor
•	Led
